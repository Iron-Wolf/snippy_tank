# Description
This is a small-scoped projet, to really grasp the inner workings of Godot engine.  
As a true first full-fledged projet, I stumbled upon many obstables.  
So, don't expect top-quality code here.  
I tinkered with a few things here and there (especialy on collisions), and rushed some
elements at the end. This is expected when you learn as you code.  
The result is far from perfect, but very close to my expectations.
